I have used inbuilt handwriting data present in keras which contains thousands of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. Using 3 different deep learning techniques (using tensorflow, using keras & using CNN) I have trained & tested data & have compared accuracy & time needed in each technique along with prediction. CNN gives highest accuracy but takes lot of time. Tensorflow gives least accuracy but is very fast. Keras stands between for both accuracy & time taken. To execute code, user just needs to run respective .py file present in each folder.
